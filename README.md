# datafun-05-sql

## Purpose of Assignment 
We'll use Python to create and manage the overall database. 

We'll use SQL to interact with the relational data and tables. 

Our DBMS is SQLite, a lightweight, file-based database widely used in browsers, mobile devices, and more. 

We'll might use several packages from the  Python Standard Library:
csv - optional - I personally prefer using pandas as the code is a bit cleaner
pathlib
sqlite3
uuid - optional - utility for creating unique ids (helpful with databases)

We'll also add an external dependency (e.g. pandas), so we'll need to create a project-specific virtual environment using venv and pip. 
pandas to read from csv with cleaner code

##Initial Steps
